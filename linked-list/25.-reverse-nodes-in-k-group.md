# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

## Question

> Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and return its modified list.
>
> _k_ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
>
> * 
> **Example:**
>
> Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`
>
> For _k_ = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`
>
> For _k_ = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`
>
> **Note:**
>
> * Only constant extra memory is allowed.
> * You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Recursive

Time complexity would be `O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var reverseKGroup = function(head, k) {
  let cur = head;
  let count = 0;
  while (cur != null) {
    cur = cur.next;
    count += 1;
  }
  
  return reverse(head, k, count);
};

const reverse = (head, k, length) => {
  if (length < k) return head;

  let pre = null;
  let cur = head;
  let count = 0;
  
  while (count < k) {
    let next = cur.next;
    cur.next = pre;
    pre = cur;
    cur = next;
    
    count += 1;
  }
  
  head.next = reverse(cur, k, length - k);

  return pre;
};
```
