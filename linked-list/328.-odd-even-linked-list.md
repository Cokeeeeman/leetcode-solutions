# 328. Odd Even Linked List

## Question

> Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
>
> You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O\(1\) space complexity and O\(nodes\) time complexity.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
> Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
> Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> * The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
> * The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...

## Analysis

#### Solution:

Just use 2 pointers as fake heads to split the list. Then concat them.

## Code

```text
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var oddEvenList = function(head) {
  const oddHead = new ListNode();
  const evenHead = new ListNode();
  
  let p1 = oddHead, p2 = evenHead;
  let cur = head;
  let odd = true;
  
  while (cur) {
    if (odd) {
      p1.next = cur;
      p1 = p1.next;
    } else {
      p2.next = cur;
      p2 = p2.next;
    }
    
    cur = cur.next;
    odd = !odd;
  }
  
  p1.next = evenHead.next;
  p2.next = null;
  
  return oddHead.next;
};
```
