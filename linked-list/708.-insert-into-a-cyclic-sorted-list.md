# 708. Insert into a Cyclic Sorted List

## Question

> Given a node from a cyclic linked list which is sorted in ascending order, write a function to insert a value into the list such that it remains a cyclic sorted list. The given node can be a reference to _any_ single node in the list, and may not be necessarily the smallest value in the cyclic list.
>
> If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the insertion, the cyclic list should remain sorted.
>
> If the list is empty \(i.e., given node is `null`\), you should create a new single cyclic list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the original given node.

> The following example may help you understand the problem better:

> In the figure above, there is a cyclic sorted list of three elements. You are given a reference to the node with value 3, and we need to insert 2 into the list.

> The new node should insert between node 1 and node 3. After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should still return node 3.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: One pass

The node can be inserted in **2 scenarios**:

1. `node1 <= insertVal <= node2, like 1 -> 1 -> [2] -> 3 -> 3`
2. `insertVal >= maxVal or insertVal <= minVal, like 3 -> 3 -> [4] -> 1 -> 1`

So all we need to do is:

1. Loop thru the cycle once, to update the max and min value, in order to get the ref to max node and min node;
2. During the loop, if we find scenario \#1, we can just insert and return;
3. Note that for scenario \#2, we need to get the ref of the **LAST** max node and the **FIRST** min node.

Time complexity would be `O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * // Definition for a Node.
 * function Node(val,next) {
 *    this.val = val;
 *    this.next = next;
 * };
 */
/**
 * @param {Node} head
 * @param {number} insertVal
 * @return {Node}
 */
var insert = function(head, insertVal) {
  if (!head) {
    const node = new Node(insertVal);
    node.next = node;
    return node;
  }

  let cur = head;
  
  let minNode;
  let maxNode;
  let min = Infinity;
  let max = -Infinity;
  
  while (true) {
    if (cur.val <= insertVal && cur.next.val >= insertVal) {
      cur.next = new Node(insertVal, cur.next);
      return head;
    }
    
    // we want to get the ref to the FIRST min node
    // this is why we use <
    if (cur.val < min) {
      min = cur.val;
      minNode = cur;
    }
    
    // we want to get the ref to the LAST max node
    // this is why we use >=
    if (cur.val >= max) {
      max = cur.val;
      maxNode = cur;
    }
    cur = cur.next;
    
    if (cur == head) break;
  }
  
  if (insertVal >= max || insertVal <= min) {
    maxNode.next = new Node(insertVal, maxNode.next);
  }

  return head;
};
```
