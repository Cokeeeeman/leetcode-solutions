# 142. Linked List Cycle II

## Question

> Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.
>
> To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position \(0-indexed\) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
>
> **Note:** Do not modify the linked list.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
> Output: tail connects to node index 1
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Constant extra space

1. Let's say starting point is `s` and circle starts at pos `x`.
2. Let 2 pointers, `slow` and `fast`, run;
3. They will eventually meet at some point, say pos `k`;
4. At the time they first meet, `fast` has run 2x the distance as `slow`.
5. Let's say `slow` has run distance `T` and the circle has circumference `S`, then we have `T + S = 2 * T`, that is, `T = S`.
6. We'll derive that `dist(s, x) = dist(k, x)`

Time complexity would be `linear`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var detectCycle = function(head) {
  if (!head) return head;
  
  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;
  
  while (fast && fast.next && fast.next.next) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    
    if (slow == fast) {
      break;
    }
  }
  
  if (!fast.next || !fast.next.next) return null;
  
  fast = head;
  while (slow != fast) {
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next;
  }
  
  return slow;
};
```
