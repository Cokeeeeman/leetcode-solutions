# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

## Question

> Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
>
> For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of _every_ node never differ by more than 1.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
>
> One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
>
>       0
>      / \
>    -3   9
>    /   /
>  -10  5
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution:

1. Get an array outa linked list;
2. Build the tree outa the array:
   1. We're going to split the array in half, use the `mid` value for root, all the numbers before that will be in the left subtree and numbers after will be the right subtree, this is because:
      1. We're trying to build a BST, and the array is sorted;
      2. We're trying to build a balanced tree, so number of nodes in the left subtree should be the same as right subtree or lightly more. \(We're trying to fill the left tree as much as possible\)
   2. Recursively build subtrees.

Time complexity would be `O(2n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var sortedListToBST = function(head) {
  const arr = [];
  let cur = head;
  while (cur) {
    arr.push(cur.val);
    cur = cur.next;
  }
  
  return build(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);
};

const build = (arr, left, right) => {
  if (left > right) return null;
  
  const mid = Math.ceil((left + right) / 2);
  const root = new TreeNode(arr[mid]);
  root.left = build(arr, left, mid - 1);
  root.right = build(arr, mid + 1, right);
  return root;
};
```
