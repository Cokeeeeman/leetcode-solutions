# 141. Linked List Cycle

## Question

> Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.
>
> To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position \(0-indexed\) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
> Output: true
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Hash

We can use a table to keep track of nodes visited.

Time complexity would be `O(n)`. Space `O(n)` for the table.

#### Solution \#2: Two pointers

Two pointers, fast and slow, fast moves 2 steps each time and slow moves 1. If there's cycle, they will meet eventually. If not, fast will just reach the end.

Time complexity would be`O(n)`.

## Code

#### Solution \#2: Two pointers

```text
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasCycle = function(head) {
  if (!head) return false;

  let slow = head;
  let fast = head;
  
  while (fast.next && fast.next.next) {
    fast = fast.next.next;
    slow = slow.next;
    
    if (fast == slow) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  
  return false;
};
```
