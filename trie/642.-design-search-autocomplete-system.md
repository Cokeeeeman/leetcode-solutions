# 642. Design Search Autocomplete System

## Question

> Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence \(at least one word and end with a special character `'#'`\). For **each character** they type **except '\#'**, you need to return the **top 3** historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:
>
> 1. The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.
> 2. The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree \(The first is the hottest one\). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order \(smaller one appears first\).
> 3. If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
> 4. When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.
>
> Your job is to implement the following functions:
>
> The constructor function:
>
> `AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times):` This is the constructor. The input is **historical data**. `Sentences` is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. `Times` is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.
>
> Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:
>
> `List<String> input(char c):` The input `c` is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters \(`'a'` to `'z'`\), blank space \(`' '`\) or a special character \(`'#'`\). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the **top 3** historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. 
>
> **Example:**  
> **Operation:** AutocompleteSystem\(\["i love you", "island","ironman", "i love leetcode"\], \[5,3,2,2\]\)  
> The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times:  
> `"i love you"` : `5` times  
> `"island"` : `3` times  
> `"ironman"` : `2` times  
> `"i love leetcode"` : `2` times  
> Now, the user begins another search:  
>   
> **Operation:** input\('i'\)  
> **Output:** \["i love you", "island","i love leetcode"\]  
> **Explanation:**  
> There are four sentences that have prefix `"i"`. Among them, "ironman" and "i love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since `' '` has ASCII code 32 and `'r'` has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode" should be in front of "ironman". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so "ironman" will be ignored.  
>   
> **Operation:** input\(' '\)  
> **Output:** \["i love you","i love leetcode"\]  
> **Explanation:**  
> There are only two sentences that have prefix `"i "`.  
>   
> **Operation:** input\('a'\)  
> **Output:** \[\]  
> **Explanation:**  
> There are no sentences that have prefix `"i a"`.  
>   
> **Operation:** input\('\#'\)  
> **Output:** \[\]  
> **Explanation:**  
> The user finished the input, the sentence `"i a"` should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search. 
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '\#', and only one blank space will exist between two words.
> 2. The number of **complete sentences** that to be searched won't exceed 100. The length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.
> 3. Please use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test cases even for a character input.
> 4. Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in class AutocompleteSystem, as static/class variables are **persisted across multiple test cases**. Please see [here](https://leetcode.com/faq/#different-output) for more details.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Trie

Test cases are not passing in leetcode.

Time complexity would be `O(?)`.

## Code

```text

  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;

var AutocompleteSystem = function(sentences, times) {
  this.root = new TrieNode();
  this.prefix = '';

  for (let i = 0; i < sentences.length; i++) {
