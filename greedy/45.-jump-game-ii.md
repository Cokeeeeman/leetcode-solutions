# 45. Jump Game II

## Question

> Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
>
> Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
>
> Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
>     Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DP \(LTE\)

Time complexity would be `O(n^2)`.

#### Solution \#2: BFS

Try to think of it as a tree, at first we are at root. At every level, we can get the range for next level, e.g. `2, 3, 1, 1, 4` will turn to:

```text
2
3, 1
1, 4    <=== end point is at level 3, which needs 2 jumps
```

1. We're at level 0 first, the range for current level is `[0, 0]`;
2. Iterate thru current nodes and calculate the range for next level;
3. When at the end of current level, update for next level.

Time complexity would be`O(n)`.

## Code

#### Solution \#1: DP \(LTE\)

```text
var jump = function(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  
  // dp[i] is the least number of jumps from
  // position 0 to position i
  const dp = new Array(n).fill(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
  dp[0] = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= nums[i]; j++) {
      dp[i + j] = Math.min(dp[i + j], dp[i] + 1);
    }
  }
  
  return dp[n - 1];
};
```

#### Solution \#2: BFS

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var jump = function(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  
  let level = 0,
      curEnd = 0,
      nextEnd = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    nextEnd = Math.max(nextEnd, nums[i] + i);
  
    if (i === curEnd) {
      level += 1;
      curEnd = nextEnd;
    }
  }

  return level;
};
```
