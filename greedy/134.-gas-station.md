# 134. Gas Station

## Question

> There are _N_ gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station _i_is `gas[i]`.
>
> You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station _i_ to its next station \(_i_+1\). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
>
> Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
>
> **Note:**
>
> * If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
> * Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
> * Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 
> gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
> cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
>
> Output: 3
>
> Explanation:
> Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
> Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
> Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
> Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
> Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
> Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
> Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 
> gas  = [2,3,4]
> cost = [3,4,3]
>
> Output: -1
>
> Explanation:
> You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
> Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
> Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
> Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
> You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
> Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: 

I don't think it's related to Greedy Algorithm, but it definitely needs mathematical proof.

The algorithm is:

1. Iterate thru the array and keep updating the **total** accumulative value of `gas[i] - cost[i]`, as well as the **smallest value** of accumulative value, let's say it's at index `i`. Then the start point is `i + 1`. 
2. If **total** value is smaller than 0, then there's no such station that you can travel around; In other words, **if total accumulative gas is larger than or equal to 0, there's always a solution and that solution must be the one right after the station that has the lowest gas**.

To prove 2nd point:

Let's say at station `k`, the accumulative gas from station `0` is the smallest, we have: `d[0] + d[1] + ... + d[k]` is the smallest, where `d[i] = gas[i] - cost[i]`. 

Then `d[k + 1] >= 0` otherwise `d[0] + d[1] + ... + d[k]` is not the smallest.

Same idea for:

`d[k + 1] + d[k + 2] >= 0`, 

`d[k + 1] + d[k + 2] + d[k + 3] >= 0`, ..., 

`d[k + 1] + d[k + 2] + d[k + 3] + ... + d[n] >= 0`. 

Now we can **conclusion \#1**: this implies **if we start from `k + 1`, we can travel to any station between `k + 1` to `n`**.

Then we need to prove that from `k + 1`, we can travel back to it.

Let's say station `j` is any random station between station `0 - k`. Since `d[0] + d[1] + ... + d[k]` is the smallest, we have:

`d[0] + d[1] + ... + d[j] > d[0] + d[1] + ... + d[k]`, then:

`(d[0] + d[1] + ... + d[j]) + (d[k + 1] + d[k + 2] + d[k + 3] + ... + d[n]) >=  (d[0] + d[1] + ... + d[k]) + (d[k + 1] + d[k + 2] + d[k + 3] + ... + d[n]) >= 0`

If we change the order a little bit, it will be easier to see:

`(d[k + 1] + d[k + 2] + d[k + 3] + ... + d[n]) + (d[0] + d[1] + ... + d[j]) >= 0`

Now we get **conclusion \#2:** It implies that **from station `k + 1`, we can travel around to any station `j`, that `j` is `[0, k]`.**

So from conclusion \#1 and \#2, we get:

**We start from station `k + 1`, where k is the station where we have the least amount of accumulative gas from station 0, we can travel back to the same station.**

Time complexity would be `O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} gas
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
var canCompleteCircuit = function(gas, cost) {
  const n = gas.length;

  let total = 0;
  let min = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  let start = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const diff = gas[i] - cost[i];
    total += diff;
    if (total < min) {
      min = total;
      start = i + 1;
    }
  }
  
  return total < 0 ? -1 : start % n;
};
