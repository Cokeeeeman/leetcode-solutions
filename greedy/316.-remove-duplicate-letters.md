# 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

## Question

> Given a string which contains only lowercase letters, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appear once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "bcabc"
> Output: "abc"
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "cbacdcbc"
> Output: "acdb"
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Stack

Intuition: If we look at the string ourselves, we scan the input from left to right, e.g. `bcabc`, when we are at letter `a`, we know that if `b` or `c` ever occur after `a`, we can remove the previous ones because in order to get lexicographically smallest answer, we need to keep `b` and `c` after `a`.

So from the intuition, when we are at a letter, we need to know what letters are included in our "temporary" answer and if they still occur in the future.

So the algorithm works like this:

1. Count the occurrences of all letters;
2. Scan input letter by letter;
   1. Keep track of what letters are already included in our answer, cuz we don't want duplicates, e.g. input is `aaaa`. If already included, skip;
   2. Compare current letter `c` with letters in stack, if stack.peek\(\) is larger than `c` and it still exists after `c`, we can remove it;
   3. Push current letter `c` into the stack and mark it as `included`
3. What's left in stack is our answer.

Time complexity would be `O(n)`. Space `O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var removeDuplicateLetters = function(s) {
  const n = s.length;
  const stack = [];
  const count = {};
  const included = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    let c = s[i];
    if (!count[c]) {
      count[c] = 0;
    }
    count[c] += 1;
    included[c] = false;
  }
  
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    let c = s[i];
    count[c] -= 1;
    
    if (included[c]) {
      continue;
    }
    
    while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1].charCodeAt(0) > c.charCodeAt(0) && count[stack[stack.length - 1]] > 0) {
      let letter = stack.pop();
      included[letter] = false;
    }
    stack.push(c);
    included[c] = true;
  }

  return stack.join('');
};
```
