# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

## Question

> Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.
>
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like \(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times\).
>
> **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> Output: 7
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>              Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>              Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
>              engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Greedy

Just try to buy at a lowest point and sell at next highest point and repeat this procedure.

Time complexity would be `O(n)`

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
  const n = prices.length;
  
  let i = 0;
  let maxProfit = 0;
  
  while (i < n) {
    let min, max;
    while (i < n - 1 && prices[i + 1] <= prices[i]) {
      i += 1;
    }
    
    min = i;
    
    while (i < n - 1 && prices[i + 1] >= prices[i]) {
      i += 1;
    }
    
    max = i;
    
    maxProfit += (prices[max] - prices[min]);
    
    i += 1;
  }
  
  return maxProfit;
};
```
