## Analysis

Greedy & Priority Queue

To arrange meetings, we can't arrange them in any random order. In common sense, we arrange them in increasing order of start time. Because we should allocate a room to a meeting in the 9:00am in the morning before we worry about the meeting starts at 5pm in the afternoon right?

So we iterate thru the meeting, for current one, we check if there's available room. But how do we check it efficiently. If we check one by one, in the worse case, where all meetings collide with each other and we have to assign a new room to each one, it's gonna take `O(n)` in average just to check available room. Then total time would be `O(n^2)`.

However, we can put our existing rooms in a priority queue where the key is the end time. So every time we get the topmost room in the priority queue, we get the one that ends the earliest. That means, if this room is not available, no other room is. Each time it takes `O(logn)` to get the min value, so total time would be `O(nlogn)`.
