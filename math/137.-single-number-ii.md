# 137. Single Number II

## Question

> Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears _three_ times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
>
> **Note:**
>
> Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,2,3,2]
> Output: 3
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
> Output: 99
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Bit Manipulation

Time complexity would be `O(32n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var singleNumber = function(nums) {
  let res = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
    // count # of 1s at bit i
    let cnt = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
      if ((num >> i) & 1 === 1) {
        cnt += 1;
      }
    }
    
    // we can even generalize from 3 to any number
    res |= ((cnt % 3) << i);
  }
  
  return res;
};
```
