# 475. Heaters

## Question

> Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
>
> Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.
>
> So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.
> 2. Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.
> 3. As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed.
> 4. All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,3],[2]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,3,4],[1,4]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Binary Search

For each house, we find the distance to the closest heater in the array `heaters` using binary search. Then we keep finding the max one.

For finding the closest heater for each house, we need to make use of the solution for [35. Search Insert Position](35.-search-insert-position.md). 

Time complexity would be `O(nlogm)` where `n` is the number of houses and `m` is the number of heaters.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} houses
 * @param {number[]} heaters
 * @return {number}
 */
var findRadius = function(houses, heaters) {
  heaters.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
  let res = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < houses.length; i++) {
    let radius = dist2ClosestHeater(houses[i], heaters);
    res = Math.max(res, radius);
  }
  return res;
};

const dist2ClosestHeater = (i, heaters) => {
  const len = heaters.length;
  let l = 0, r = heaters.length - 1;
  
  while (l < r) {
    let m = Math.floor((l + r) / 2);
    if (heaters[m] === i) {
      return 0;
    } else if (i < heaters[m]) {
      r = m - 1;
    } else {
      l = m + 1;
    }
  }
  
  if (heaters[l] === i) {
    return 0;
  } else if (heaters[l] > i) {
    return l === 0 ? heaters[l] - i : Math.min(heaters[l] - i, i - heaters[l - 1]);
  } else {
    return l === len - 1 ? i - heaters[l] : Math.min(i - heaters[l], heaters[l + 1] - i);
  }
};
```
