# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

##  Question <a id="question"></a>

> You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:
>
> ```text
> struct Node {
>   int val;
>   Node *left;
>   Node *right;
>   Node *next;
> }
> ```
>
> Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.
>
> Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.
>
> **Example:**

> Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"3","left":null,"next":{"$id":"4","left":null,"next":{"$id":"5","left":null,"next":{"$id":"6","left":null,"next":null,"right":null,"val":7},"right":null,"val":6},"right":null,"val":5},"right":null,"val":4},"next":{"$id":"7","left":{"$ref":"5"},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"6"},"val":3},"right":{"$ref":"4"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$ref":"7"},"val":1}
>
> Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.

## Analysis <a id="analysis"></a>

#### Solution \#1: BFS using queue <a id="solution-1-brute-force"></a>

Time complexity would be `O(n)`. But space exceeds the limit. `O(2^(h-1))`, for the last level of nodes.

#### Solution \#2: BFS <a id="solution-2"></a>

Time complexity would be`O(n)`. Space is `O(1)`.

## Code <a id="code"></a>

#### Solution \#1

```text
var connect = function(root) {
  if (!root) return root;
  const q = [ root ];
  while (q.length > 0) {
    const size = q.length;
    let pre;
    for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      const cur = q.shift();
      if (pre) {
        pre.next = cur;
      }
      if (i === size - 1) {
        cur.next = null;
      }
      if (cur.left) q.push(cur.left);
      if (cur.right) q.push(cur.right);
      pre = cur;
    }
  }
  return root;
};
```

#### Solution \#2

```text
var connect = function(root) {
  if (!root) return root;
  let levelStart = root;
  while (levelStart) {
    let cur = levelStart;
    while (cur) {
      if (cur.left) cur.left.next = cur.right;
      if (cur.right && cur.next) cur.right.next = cur.next.left;
      cur = cur.next;
    }
    levelStart = levelStart.left;
  }
  return root;
};
```
