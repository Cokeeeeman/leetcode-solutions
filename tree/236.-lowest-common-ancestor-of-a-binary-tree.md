# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## Question

> Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes in the tree.
>
> According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\).”
>
> Given the following binary tree:  root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\]![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
> Output: 5
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> * All of the nodes' values will be unique.
> * p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DFS

Time complexity would be `O(2n + logn)`. It takes `n` to search for either `p` and `q` using DFS. Then it takes at most `O(logn)` to compare 2 paths.

## Code

```text
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {TreeNode} p
 * @param {TreeNode} q
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
  const path1 = [];
  const path2 = [];
  dfs(root, p, path1);
  dfs(root, q, path2);
  let lca = null;
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(path1.length, path2.length); i++) {
    if (path1[i] == path2[i]) {
      lca = path1[i];
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }
  return lca;
};

const dfs = (root, target, path) => {
  if (!root) return false;
  
  path.push(root);
  if (root === target) return true;
  if (dfs(root.left, target, path) || dfs(root.right, target, path)) return true;
  
  path.pop(root);
  return false;
}
```
