# 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator

## Question

> Implement an iterator over a binary search tree \(BST\). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.
>
> Calling `next()` will return the next smallest number in the BST.

> * `next()` and `hasNext()` should run in average O\(1\) time and uses O\(h\) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
> * You may assume that `next()` call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when `next()` is called.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Stack

At first I was thinking using inorder traversal to store the result in an array of `O(n)` so that all values are in a sorted manner. But it doesn't meet the requirement of using `O(h)` memory.

We'll have to make use of the structure of BST, which is, nodes in left subtree are always smaller than root and right subtree bigger than root.

1. First we traverse all the way to the very last left leaf, which is the smallest in the whole tree. Now if we need to call `next()` we'll just pop the stack, say we get `smallest`. 
2. Then we need to maintain the stack, what is the next smallest node? That would be the left most leaf of the right subtree of `smallest`. So we'll need to push nodes along the way to that leaf.

Time complexity for `hasNext()` is `O(1)`. But for `next()`, I'm not sure it's on average `O(1)` but in worst case it's `O(h)`. Memory is `O(h)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 */
var BSTIterator = function(root) {
  const stack = [];
  let cur = root;
  while (cur) {
    stack.push(cur);
    cur = cur.left;
  }
  this.stack = stack;
};

/**
 * @return the next smallest number
 * @return {number}
 */
BSTIterator.prototype.next = function() {
  if (!this.hasNext()) return null;
  const stack = this.stack;
  const node = stack.pop();
  if (node.right) {
    let next = node.right;
    while (next) {
      stack.push(next);
      next = next.left;
    }
  }
  return node.val;
};

/**
 * @return whether we have a next smallest number
 * @return {boolean}
 */
BSTIterator.prototype.hasNext = function() {
  return this.stack.length !== 0;
};

/** 
 * Your BSTIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new BSTIterator(root)
 * var param_1 = obj.next()
 * var param_2 = obj.hasNext()
 */
```
