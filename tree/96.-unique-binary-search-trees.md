## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DP

`dp[i]` represents the number of BSTs it can form from `1 to i`. Apparently `dp[n]` is the answer that we want.

$$
F(i) = Î£F(j - 1)*F(i - j), 1<=j<=i
$$

Based on observation, for input `i`, the trees will be using 1 as root, 2 as root, ..., i as root. When a tree uses `j` as root, the left tree can only use number `1 - (j-1)`, so left tree is `F(j-1)`, right tree can use `j + 1 to i`, that's `F(i-j)`. So `F(i)` is the sum of all that.

Time complexity would be `O(n^2)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var numTrees = function(n) {
  const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  
  dp[0] = 1;
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
    }
  }
  
  return dp[n];
};
```
