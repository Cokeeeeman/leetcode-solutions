# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

## Question

> Given a **non-empty** binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
>
> For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the root.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,3]
>
>        1
>       / \
>      2   3
>
> Output: 6
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
>
>    -10
>    / \
>   9  20
>     /  \
>    15   7
>
> Output: 42
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Recursion

Time complexity would be `O(?)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxPathSum = function(root) {
  let max = -Infinity;
  
  // maxGain is the max value starting from current node
  // following a tree path, by tree path, it means we only
  // allow parent to child traverse
  
  // we define this subproblem is because,
  // for the final path we're finding, it's a sum of
  // root's val + left path + right path
  const maxGain = node => {
    if (!node) return 0;
    
    const leftGain = Math.max(maxGain(node.left), 0);
    const rightGain = Math.max(maxGain(node.right), 0);
    
    max = Math.max(node.val + leftGain + rightGain, max);
    
    return node.val + Math.max(leftGain, rightGain);
  };
  
  maxGain(root);
  return max;
};
```
