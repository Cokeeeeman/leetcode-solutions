## Analysis

Should know the difference between INNER JOIN & OUTER JOIN, as well as LEFT OUTER JOIN & RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

For this question, it asks to get all the records in Person table, regardless if it has address corresponding to the person. So it's gonna be LEFT OUTER JOIN.

## Code

```text
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT FirstName, LastName, City, State FROM Person
LEFT OUTER JOIN Address
ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;
```
