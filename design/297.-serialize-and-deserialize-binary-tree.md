# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

## Question

> Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
>
> Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
>
> **Example:** 
>
> ```text
> You may serialize the following tree:
>
>     1
>    / \
>   2   3
>      / \
>     4   5
>
> as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
> ```
>
> **Clarification:** The above format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
>
> **Note:** Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DFS, Preorder

Time complexity would be `O(n)`, for both serialize and deserialize, because we're gonna visit every node once. `n` is the number of nodes.

Space is `O(n)` too, because the max number of call stacks would be the number of nodes, which is `O(n)`.

#### Solution \#2: BFS

@todo

Time complexity would be`O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = this.right = null;
 * }
 */
const rserialize = (root, result) => {
  if (!root) {
    result += '#,';
    return result;
  }
  
  result += root.val + ',';
  // be careful with the value of result here
  // don't do result += rserialize(root.left, result)
  // because when you pass the string 'result' in to the func
  // whatever the func returns is based on result
  // e.g. [1, null, null]
  // when we at 1, result is currently '1'
  // when trying to serialize left child, which is null
  // we pass result = '1,' to the recursive func
  // it's build result on top of that and return us '1,#,'
  result = rserialize(root.left, result);
  result = rserialize(root.right, result);
  return result;
};
/**
 * Encodes a tree to a single string.
 *
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {string}
 */
var serialize = function(root) {
  return rserialize(root, '');
};

const rdeserialize = (list) => {
  
  // if (list.length < 1) return null;
  
  // splice will modify the orignal array
  // this is what we want
  // because in each recursive call
  // when we deserialize, we want list to
  // update itself after nodes are built
  const val = list.splice(0, 1);
  if (val == '#') {
    return null;
  }
  const node = new TreeNode(val);
  node.left = rdeserialize(list);
  node.right = rdeserialize(list);
  return node;
};

/**
 * Decodes your encoded data to tree.
 *
 * @param {string} data
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var deserialize = function(data) {
  return rdeserialize(data.split(','));
};

/**
 * Your functions will be called as such:
 * deserialize(serialize(root));
 */
```
