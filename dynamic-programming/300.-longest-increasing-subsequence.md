# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Question

> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
> Output: 4 
> Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> * There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
> * Your algorithm should run in O\(n2\) complexity.
>
> **Follow up:** Could you improve it to O\(n log n\) time complexity?

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DP

Time complexity would be `O(n^2)`. Space `O(n)`.

#### Solution \#2: DP with Binary Search

@todo

Time complexity would be`O(nlogn)`.

## Code

#### Solution \#1: DP

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLIS = function(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

  const len = nums.length;
  const dp = new Array(len).fill(1);
  
  let max = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[j] + 1, dp[i]);
      }
    }
    max = Math.max(dp[i], max);
  }
  
  return max;
};
```
