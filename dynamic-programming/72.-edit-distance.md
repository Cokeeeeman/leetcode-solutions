# 72. Edit Distance

## Question

> Given two words _word1_ and _word2_, find the minimum number of operations required to convert _word1_ to _word2_.
>
> You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
>
> 1. Insert a character
> 2. Delete a character
> 3. Replace a character
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: 
> horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
> rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
> rose -> ros (remove 'e')
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
> Output: 5
> Explanation: 
> intention -> inention (remove 't')
> inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
> enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
> exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
> exection -> execution (insert 'u')

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DP

Let's say `dp[i][j]` represents the edit distance for the first `i` characters of `word1` and first `j` characters of `word2`. In order to calculate `dp[i][j]`, we have 2 possible cases:

1. Characters match

`word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1], dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1].`  
Because last char is the same, so we only need to think about how to transform `i-1` chars of `word1` to `j-1` chars of `word2`. E.g. if `word1 = "abc"` and `word2 = "dc"`, we only need to calculate the steps to convert `"ab"` to `"d"`.

2. Characters don't match

`word1[i - 1] != word2[j - 1]`, we only can do insert, delete and replace, so we have 3 sub-cases:

a. `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + 1` =&gt; delete  
E.g. "abc" =&gt; "de", we transform "ab" to "de", so `word1` becomes "dec", then we delete "c";

b. `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1` =&gt; insert  
E.g. "abc" =&gt; "de", we transform "abc" to "d" and then insert "e"

c. `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1` =&gt; replace  
E.g. "abc" =&gt; "de", we transform "ab" to "d", so `word1` becomes "dc", then replace "c" with "e"

So of all 3 sub-cases, we get the min one:  
`dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1;`

Time complexity would be `O(len1*len2)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {number}
 */
var minDistance = function(word1, word2) {
  const len1 = word1.length, len2 = word2.length;
  const dp = new Array(len1 + 1).fill(0).map(row => new Array(len2 + 1).fill(0));
  for (let i = 1; i <= len1; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = i;
  }
  for (let j = 1; j <= len2; j++) {
    dp[0][j] = j;
  }
  for (let i = 1; i <= len1; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= len2; j++) {
      if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1;
      }
    }
  } 
  
  return dp[len1][len2];
};
```
