# 198. House Robber

## Question

> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
>
> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,3,1]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
>              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
> Output: 12
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
>              Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
> ```

## Analysis

#### Dynamic Programming

2 cases: rob the current one, or not

* If rob the current one, `amount = rob(i - 2) + currentValue`;
* If not, `amount = rob(i - 1)`.

So `rob(i) = max(rob(i - 2) + currentValue, rob(i - 1))`;

#### Solution \#1: Iterative + memo, bottom-up

Time complexity would be `O(n)`. Space is also `O(n)`.

#### Solution \#2: Iterative + N\(constant\) variables, bottom-up

The previous solution only uses `dp[i]`, `dp[i - 1]`, `dp[i - 2]`. So we can just use 3 variables.

Time complexity would be`O(n)`. Space is `O(1)`.

## Code

### Iterative + memo, bottom-up

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var rob = function(nums) {
  if (!nums || nums.length === 0) return 0;

  const n = nums.length;
  // dp[i] represents the max amount to rob for the first i houses
  // so dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = nums[0];
  const dp = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  
  dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = nums[0];
  for (let i = 2; i < n + 1; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 2] + nums[i - 1], dp[i - 1]);  
  }
  return dp[n];
};
```

### Iterative + N\(constant\) variables, bottom-up

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var rob = function(nums) {
  let pre1 = 0, pre2 = 0, cur = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    cur = Math.max(pre2 + nums[i], pre1);
    pre2 = pre1;
    pre1 = cur;
  }
  
  return cur;
};
```
