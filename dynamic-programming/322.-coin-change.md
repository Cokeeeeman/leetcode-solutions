# 322. Coin Change

## Question

> You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
> Output: 3 
> Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
> Output: -1
> ```
>
> **Note**:  
> You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DP, bottom-up approach

Define `dp[i]` is the min number of coins to make amount `i`. It has optimal structure, which means the optimal solution can be constructed by optimal solutions of subproblems:

`dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i-c0], dp[i-c1], ..., dp[i-cn]) + 1`

Time complexity would be `O(S*n)`, where `S` is the amount and `n` is the number of coins. Space would be `O(S)` to store the table.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} coins
 * @param {number} amount
 * @return {number}
 */
var coinChange = function(coins, amount) {
  // dp[i] represents the min number of coins to make amount i
  const dp = Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
  dp[0] = 0;
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < coins.length; j++) {
      if (i - coins[j] >= 0) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coins[j]] + 1);
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] == Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
};
```
