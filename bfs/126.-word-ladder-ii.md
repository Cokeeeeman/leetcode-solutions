# 126. Word Ladder II

## Question

> Given two words \(_beginWord_ and _endWord_\), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence\(s\) from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:
>
> 1. Only one letter can be changed at a time
> 2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that _beginWord_ is _not_ a transformed word.
>
> **Note:**
>
> * Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
> * All words have the same length.
> * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
> * You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
> * You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> beginWord = "hit",
> endWord = "cog",
> wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
>
> Output:
> [
>   ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
>   ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
> ]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> beginWord = "hit"
> endWord = "cog"
> wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
>
> Output: []
>
> Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: BFS + DFS

1. Use BFS to build the graph:
   1. When building the graph, we use a map `distance` to keep track of the min distance from `beginWord` to current candidate. How do you know it's min distance? Because we use BFS to search down the tree level by level, and we don't revisit nodes that are visited.
   2. This is very similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, note that Dijkstra's algorithm is usually used to find the shortest path for weighted undirected graph. Or we could say, this is a special case of weighted graph because we can treat each edge as weighted 1.
2. Then we use DFS to find all the answers. 
   1. Key point here is, sine we have the `distance` map, we can check if the current path we build is the shortest path. E.g. if current path we have `[hit, hot]`, we're at word `hot`. The word `hot` has several neighbors like `hit, hat, etc`. We'll iterate thru each neighbor to go into next level. But first neighbor is `hit`, if we pick `hit`, the distance for next level will be `3`, which is not the shortest path for hit because `distance[hit]` is `1`. In this way, we prevent loops and also prune a lot of the branches for the tree.
   2. Another thing to pay attention is backtrack. 

Time complexity would be `O(n + n*l*26)`, where `l` is length of each word and `n` is the number of words in dict. Time for BFS or DFS is `O(V + E)`, here `V` is number of words in dict. The worst case would be, for any word in the dict, all 26 letters for all digits are its neighbors, e.g. for word `aa`, `ba, ca, ..., za and ab, ac, ..., az` are all neighbors, which is `26 * l` edges for each word. So in the worst case, there's `26 * l * n` edges in the graph. So `O(V + E) = O(n + 26 * l * n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {string} beginWord
 * @param {string} endWord
 * @param {string[]} wordList
 * @return {string[][]}
 */
var findLadders = function(beginWord, endWord, wordList) {
  const res = [];
  const graph = {};
  const distance = {};
  const dict = new Set(wordList);
  const path = [];
  bfs(beginWord, endWord, distance, graph, dict);
  // console.log(distance);
  // console.log(graph);
  dfs(beginWord, endWord, distance, graph, path, res);
  return res;
};

const bfs = (beginWord, endWord, distance, graph, dict) => {
  const q = [ beginWord ];
  distance[beginWord] = 1;
  while (q.length > 0) {
    const size = q.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      const word = q.shift();

      const neighbors = getNeighbors(word, dict);
      if (!graph[word]) {
        graph[word] = neighbors;
      }
      
      for (let neighbor of neighbors) {
        if (!distance[neighbor]) {
          distance[neighbor] = distance[word] + 1;
          q.push(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
};
      
const getNeighbors = (word, dict) => {
  const neighbors = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
    const char = word[i];
    for (let j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
      const letter = String.fromCharCode('a'.charCodeAt(0) + j);
      if (letter == char) continue;
      
      const newWord = word.substring(0, i) + letter + word.substring(i + 1);
      if (dict.has(newWord)) {
        neighbors.push(newWord);
      }
    }
  }
  return neighbors;
};
  
const dfs = (word, endWord, distance, graph, path, res) => {
  path.push(word);
  if (word == endWord) {
    res.push(path.slice(0));
    path.pop();
    return;
  }
  
  for (let neighbor of graph[word]) {
    if (path.length + 1 == distance[neighbor]) {
      dfs(neighbor, endWord, distance, graph, path, res);
    }
  }
  path.pop();
};
