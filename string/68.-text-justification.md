# 68. Text Justification

## Question

> Given an array of words and a width _maxWidth_, format the text such that each line has exactly _maxWidth_ characters and is fully \(left and right\) justified.
>
> You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly _maxWidth_ characters.
>
> Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
>
> For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no **extra** space is inserted between words.
>
> **Note:**
>
> * A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
> * Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed _maxWidth_.
> * The input array `words` contains at least one word.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
> maxWidth = 16
> Output:
> [
>    "This    is    an",
>    "example  of text",
>    "justification.  "
> ]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
> maxWidth = 16
> Output:
> [
>   "What   must   be",
>   "acknowledgment  ",
>   "shall be        "
> ]
> Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
>              because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
>              Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
>          "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
> maxWidth = 20
> Output:
> [
>   "Science  is  what we",
>   "understand      well",
>   "enough to explain to",
>   "a  computer.  Art is",
>   "everything  else  we",
>   "do                  "
> ]
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution:

This problem is not hard to solve, but quite cumbersome.

Things to pay attention:

1. How to evenly distribute spaces? 
   1. We can do `Math.ceil(spacesLeft / slots)`
2. How to calculate how many words can fit in the current row? 
   1. Here we gradually add one more word into the current row;
   2. Keep a variable for counting existing length, so we can save some time, we don't have to count length for every word whenever we add a new word.

Time complexity would be `O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {number} maxWidth
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var fullJustify = function(words, maxWidth) {
  const n = words.length;
  const res = [];
  let i = 0;
  
  while (i < n) {
    // len only count length of words, no spaces included
    let len = 0;
    let j = 0;
    while (i + j < n) {
      let cur = words[i + j].length;
      // j just happens to be the same as the number of spaces
      if (len + cur + j > maxWidth) {
        break;
      } else {
        len += cur;
        j += 1;
      }
    }
  
    let totalSpaces = maxWidth - len;
    let row = '';
    
    // if it's last row
    if (i + j === n) {
      for (let k = 0; k < j; k++) {
        row += words[i + k];

        if (k !== j - 1) {
          row += ' ';
          totalSpaces -= 1;
        } else {
          while (totalSpaces > 0) {
            row += ' ';
            totalSpaces -= 1;
          }
        }
      }
    } else {
      // if not last row
      for (let k = 0; k < j; k++) {
        row += words[i + k];
        
        // if after last word is appended to the row and there's still
        // spaces left, append rest of the spaces
        // this will only happen when there's only 1 word in the row
        // like "justification   "
        if (k === j - 1) {
          while (totalSpaces > 0) {
            row += ' ';
            totalSpaces -= 1;
          }
        } else {

          let spaces = Math.ceil(totalSpaces / (j - k - 1));
          totalSpaces -= spaces;
          while (spaces > 0) {
            row += ' ';
            spaces -= 1;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  
    res.push(row);
    i += j;
  }
  
  // console.log(res)
  return res;
};
```
