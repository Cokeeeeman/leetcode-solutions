# 443. String Compression

## Question

> Given an array of characters, compress it [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).
>
> The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
>
> Every element of the array should be a **character** \(not int\) of length 1.
>
> After you are done **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), return the new length of the array. 
>
> **Follow up:**  
> Could you solve it using only O\(1\) extra space? 
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
>
> Output:
> Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
>
> Explanation:
> "aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> ["a"]
>
> Output:
> Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]
>
> Explanation:
> Nothing is replaced.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
>
> Output:
> Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
>
> Explanation:
> Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
> Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. All characters have an ASCII value in `[35, 126]`.
> 2. `1 <= len(chars) <= 1000`.

## Analysis

#### Solution:

Two pointers `read` and `write` and we make sure `read` is always ahead of `write`.

Time complexity would be `O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {character[]} chars
 * @return {number}
 */
var compress = function(chars) {
  let read = 0, write = 0;
  while (read < chars.length) {
    const ch = chars[read];
    let count = 0;
    while (chars[read] == ch) {
      count += 1;
      read += 1;
    }
    
    chars[write] = ch;
    write += 1;
    
    if (count >= 2) {
      count = String(count);
      for (let i = 0; i < count.length; i++) {
        chars[write] = count[i];
        write += 1;
      }
      
      // console.log(chars)
    }
  }
  
  // console.log(write)
  
  return write;
};
```
