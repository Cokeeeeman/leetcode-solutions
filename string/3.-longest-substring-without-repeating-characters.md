# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Question

> Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "abcabcbb"
> Output: 3 
> Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "bbbbb"
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "pwwkew"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
>              Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Two Pointers

Sliding window. In the window, we make sure there's no repeating characters. 

We'll use `map` to keep track of unique characters. 

For current character, if it occurs before, we'll update window.

Time complexity would be `O(n)`. Space `O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
  const map = new Map();
  let l = 0, r = 0;
  let max = 0;
  
  while (r < s.length) {
    const char = s[r];
    if (map.has(char)) {
      // l doesn't go back, see example 'abba'
      l = Math.max(map.get(char) + 1, l);
    }
    map.set(char, r);
    max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
    r += 1;
  }
  
  return max;
};
```
