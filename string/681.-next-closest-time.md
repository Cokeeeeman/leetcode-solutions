# 681. Next Closest Time

## Question

> Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.
>
> You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "19:34"
> Output: "19:39"
> Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.  It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: "23:59"
> Output: "22:22"
> Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22. It may be assumed that the returned time is next day's time since it is smaller than the input time numerically.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Enumerate all possible candidates

We'll use all digits to enumerate all possible time. Note that for comparing time, we'll translate time to minutes. E.g. 12:00 is 720.

To calculate time elapsed from given `time` to one of our `candidate`, if `candidate - time` is negative, we'll add another 24 \* 60 to get the correct result. 

Time complexity would be `O(4 * 4 * 4 * 4)`.

#### Solution \#2: 

Time complexity would be`O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {string} time
 * @return {string}
 */
var nextClosestTime = function(time) {
  const parts = time.split(':');
  const h = parseInt(parts[0]);
  const m = parseInt(parts[1]);
  
  const start = h * 60 + m;
  
  const set = new Set([
    parseInt(time[0]),
    parseInt(time[1]),
    parseInt(time[3]),
    parseInt(time[4])
  ]);
  
  const digits = Array.from(set);
  
  let minElapsed = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  let res = time;

  for (let h1 of digits) {
    for (let h2 of digits) {
      if (h1 * 10 + h2 < 24) {
        for (let m1 of digits) {
          for (let m2 of digits) {
            if (m1 * 10 + m2 < 60) {
              const time = (h1 * 10 + h2) * 60 + (m1 * 10 + m2);
              const elapsed = time - start < 0 ? (time - start + 24 * 60) : (time - start);
              if (elapsed === 0) continue;
              
              if (elapsed < minElapsed) {
                minElapsed = elapsed;
                res = `${h1}${h2}:${m1}${m2}`;
              }
            }
          } 
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  return res;
};
```
