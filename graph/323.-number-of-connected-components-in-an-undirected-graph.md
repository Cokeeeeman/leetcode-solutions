# 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

## Question

> Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of undirected edges \(each edge is a pair of nodes\), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]
>
>      0          3
>      |          |
>      1 --- 2    4 
>
> Output: 2
> ```

> **Example 2:**

> ```text
> Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
>
>      0           4
>      |           |
>      1 --- 2 --- 3
>
> Output:  1

> **Note:**  
> You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in `edges`. Since all edges are undirected, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in `edges`.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Union Find

Time complexity would be `O(?)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number}
 */
var countComponents = function(n, edges) {
  let count = n;
  const parent = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    parent[i] = i;
  }
  
  for (let edge of edges) {
    let x = find(edge[0], parent);
    let y = find(edge[1], parent);
    
    // if it's a cycle, they are already in one set,
    // we don't have to union
    if (x !== y) {
      parent[x] = y;
      count -= 1;
    }
  }
  // console.log(parent)
  return count;
};

const find = (x, parent) => {
  if (parent[x] == x) return x;
  
  return find(parent[x], parent);
}
```
