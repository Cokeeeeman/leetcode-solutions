# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

## Question

> Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with `JFK`.
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
> 2. All airports are represented by three capital letters \(IATA code\).
> 3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
> Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
> Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
> Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
>              But it is larger in lexical order.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DFS

Refer to: [https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/discuss/78799/Very-Straightforward-DFS-Solution-with-Detailed-Explanations](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/discuss/78799/Very-Straightforward-DFS-Solution-with-Detailed-Explanations)

Time complexity would be `O(?)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {string[][]} tickets
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var findItinerary = function(tickets) {
  const graph = {};
  // build graph
  for (let ticket of tickets) {
    const from = ticket[0];
    const to = ticket[1];
    if (!graph[from]) {
      graph[from] = [];
    }
    graph[from].push(to);
  }
  
  // sort 'to's in lexical order
  for (let from in graph) {
    graph[from].sort();
  }
  
  // console.log("graph: ", graph)
  
  const res = [ 'JFK' ];
  
  dfs('JFK', graph, res);
  
  return res;
};

const dfs = (cur, graph, res) => {
  // if used up all tickets, we built the itinerary 
  if (Object.keys(graph).length === 0) return true;
  
  // if we stuck at cur and have no wehre to go, that
  // means we have to go back and try other tickets
  if (!graph[cur]) return false;
  
  const neighbors = graph[cur];
  for (let i = 0; i < neighbors.length; i++) {
    const to = neighbors[i];
    res.push(to);
    neighbors.splice(i, 1);
    
    if (neighbors.length === 0) {
      delete graph[cur];
    }
    
    if (dfs(to, graph, res)) return true;
    
    neighbors.splice(i, 0, to);
    graph[cur] = neighbors
    res.pop();
  }
  
  return false;
};
