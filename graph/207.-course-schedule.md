# 207. Course Schedule

## Question

> There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
>
> Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`
>
> Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
> Output: true
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
> Output: false
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
>              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

> **Note:**

> 1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
> 2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Topological Ordering, Kahn's algorithm

Time complexity would be `O(V + E)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number} numCourses
 * @param {number[][]} prerequisites
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canFinish = function(numCourses, prerequisites) {
  const graph = Array(numCourses).fill().map(row => []);
  const indegrees = Array(numCourses).fill(0);
  for (let pair of prerequisites) {
    const course = pair[0];
    const pre = pair[1];
    graph[pre].push(course);
    indegrees[course] += 1;
  }
  
  const q = [];
  for (let course = 0; course < numCourses; course++) {
    if (indegrees[course] === 0) {
      q.push(course);
    }
  }
  // console.log("graph: ", graph)
  // console.log("indegrees: ", indegrees)
  const res = [];
  while (q.length > 0) {
    const node = q.shift();
    res.push(node);
    
    const neighbors = graph[node];
    for (let neighbor of neighbors) {
      indegrees[neighbor]--;
      if (indegrees[neighbor] === 0) {
        q.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }

  // if all vertices in topological ordering(a.k.a indegree is 0)
  // if not, there's a cycle
  return res.length === numCourses;
};
```
