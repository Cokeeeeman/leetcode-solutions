# 269. Alien Dictionary

## Question

> There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** words from the dictionary, where **words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [
>   "wrt",
>   "wrf",
>   "er",
>   "ett",
>   "rftt"
> ]
>
> Output: "wertf"
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [
>   "z",
>   "x"
> ]
>
> Output: "zx"
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [
>   "z",
>   "x",
>   "z"
> ] 
>
> Output: "" 
>
> Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
> 2. You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
> 3. If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
> 4. There may be multiple valid order of letters, return any one of them is fine.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Topological Sorting, Kahn's Algorithm

The problem can be transformed into finding the topological ordering of a DAG.

We'll build a graph, represented in adjacency list, based on the input. We'll compare each pair of two adjacent strings, letter by letter, to form the edges.

E.g. given input `['x', 'z']`, we'll build a graph based on that and the graph would be one edge `E(x, z)`. 

It takes `O(|V| + |E|)` to build the graph and perform Kahn's algorithm.

Time complexity would be `O(|V| + |E|)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {string}
 */
var alienOrder = function(words) {
  const graph = new Map();
  // initialize the graph with all characters appear in words
  words.forEach(word => {
    word.split('').forEach(ch => graph.set(ch, new Set()))
  });
  
  // build the graph
  for (let i = 1; i < words.length; i++) {
    const pre = words[i - 1];
    const cur = words[i];
    
    let index = 0;
    let ch1, ch2;
    while (index < pre.length && index < cur.length) {
      ch1 = pre[index];
      ch2 = cur[index];
      
      if (ch1 !== ch2) {
        graph.get(ch1).add(ch2);
        break;
      }
    
      index += 1;
    }
  }
  
  // Kahn's algorithm to get topological ordering
  const indegree = new Map();
  for (let vertice of graph.keys()) {
    indegree.set(vertice, 0);
  } 

  for (let neighbors of graph.values()) {
    for (let neighbor of neighbors) {
      indegree.set(neighbor, indegree.get(neighbor) + 1);
    }
  }
  
  let result = '';
  const queue = [];
  for (let [ vertice, degree ] of indegree) {
    if (degree === 0) {
      queue.push(vertice);
    }
  }

  while (queue.length !== 0) {
    let u = queue.shift();
    result += u;
    let neighbors = graph.get(u);
    for (let v of neighbors) {
      indegree.set(v, indegree.get(v) - 1);
      if (indegree.get(v) === 0) {
        queue.push(v);
      }
    }
  }
  
  // if the final result, topological ordering, doesn't
  // have all vertices, then it has cycles
  return result.length === graph.size ? result : '';
};
```
