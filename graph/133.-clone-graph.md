# 133. Clone Graph

## Question

> Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_%28graph_theory%29#Connected_graph) undirected graph, return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy)\(clone\) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val \(`int`\) and a list \(`List[Node]`\) of its neighbors.

> Input:
> {"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}
>
> Explanation:
> Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
> Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
> Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
> Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.

> **Note:**
>
> 1. The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
> 2. The undirected graph is a [simple graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28discrete_mathematics%29#Simple_graph), which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
> 3. Since the graph is undirected, if node _p_ has node _q_ as neighbor, then node _q_ must have node _p_ as neighbor too.
> 4. You must return the **copy of the given node** as a reference to the cloned graph.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DFS

Inside each recursion, we do 2 things:

1. Clone current node if necessary;
2. Assign neighbors

Note that `map` is used to store clones that are already created, also it tells us which node has already been visited, because you'll have to visit the node before you clone it.

Time complexity would be `O(V + E)`.

#### Solution \#2: BFS

Same idea as DFS. For each loop in while\(\), you do 2 things:

1. Clone itself if necessary;
2. Assign neighbors and clone neighbors if necessary.

Time complexity would be `O(V + E)`.

## Code

#### Solution \#1: DFS

```text
/**
 * // Definition for a Node.
 * function Node(val,neighbors) {
 *    this.val = val;
 *    this.neighbors = neighbors;
 * };
 */
/**
 * @param {Node} node
 * @return {Node}
 */
var cloneGraph = function(node) {
  const map = {};
  return dfs(node, map);
  
};

const dfs = (node, map) => {
  if (map[node.val]) return map[node.val];

  const clone = new Node(node.val, []);
  map[node.val] = clone;
  
  const neighborClones = [];
  for (let neighbor of node.neighbors) {
    neighborClones.push(dfs(neighbor, map));
  }
  clone.neighbors = neighborClones;
  return clone;
};
```

#### Solution \#1: BFS

```text
/**
 * // Definition for a Node.
 * function Node(val,neighbors) {
 *    this.val = val;
 *    this.neighbors = neighbors;
 * };
 */
/**
 * @param {Node} node
 * @return {Node}
 */
var cloneGraph = function(node) {
  const map = {};
  const q = [ node ];
  
  while (q.length > 0) {
    const node = q.shift();
    const clone = map[node.val] ? map[node.val] : new Node(node.val, []);
    map[node.val] = clone;
    
    const neighborClones = [];
    for (let neighbor of node.neighbors) {
      let neighborClone;
      if (map[neighbor.val]) {
        neighborClone = map[neighbor.val];
      } else {
        neighborClone = new Node(neighbor.val, []);
        map[neighbor.val] = neighborClone;
        q.push(neighbor);
      }
      neighborClones.push(neighborClone);
    }
    clone.neighbors = neighborClones;
  }
  
  return map[node.val];
};
