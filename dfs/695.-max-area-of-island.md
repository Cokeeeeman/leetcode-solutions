# 695. Max Area of Island

## Question

> Given a non-empty 2D array `grid` of 0's and 1's, an **island** is a group of `1`'s \(representing land\) connected 4-directionally \(horizontal or vertical.\) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
>
> Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. \(If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.\)
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
> ```
>
> Given the above grid, return `6`. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

> Given the above grid, return `0`.

## Analysis

#### Solution: DFS

Time complexity would be `O(mn)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxAreaOfIsland = function(grid) {
  if (!grid || grid.length === 0 || grid[0].length === 0) return 0;

  const m = grid.length;
  const n = grid[0].length;
  let max = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      const counter = { count: 0 };
      dfs(grid, i, j, counter);
      max = Math.max(max, counter.count);
    }
  }
  
  return max;
};

const dfs = (grid, i, j, counter) => {
  const m = grid.length;
  const n = grid[0].length;
  
  if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n) return;
  if (grid[i][j] != 1) return;
  
  counter.count += 1;
  
  grid[i][j] = '#';
  
  dfs(grid, i + 1, j, counter);
  dfs(grid, i - 1, j, counter);
  dfs(grid, i, j + 1, counter);
  dfs(grid, i, j - 1, counter);
}
```
