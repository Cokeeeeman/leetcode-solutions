# 130. Surrounded Regions

## Question

> Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` \(**the letter O**\), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.
>
> A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> X X X X
> X O O X
> X X O X
> X O X X
> ```
>
> After running your function, the board should be:
>
> ```text
> X X X X
> X X X X
> X X X X
> X O X X
> ```
>
> **Explanation:**
>
> Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: DFS

Start from boarder 'O's. Convert them to '\#'s because they are not surrounded.

Then convert the rest of the 'O's to 'X's and '\#'s back to 'O's.

Time complexity would be `O(mn)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {character[][]} board
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
 */
var solve = function(board) {
  if (!board || board.length === 0) return;
  const m = board.length;
  const n = board[0].length;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    if (board[i][0] == 'O') {
      dfs(board, i, 0);
    }
    if (board[i][n - 1] == 'O') {
      dfs(board, i, n - 1);
    }
  }
  
  for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    if (board[0][j] == 'O') {
      dfs(board, 0, j);
    }
    if (board[m - 1][j] == 'O') {
      dfs(board, m - 1, j);
    }
  }
  
  for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (board[i][j] == 'O') {
        board[i][j] = 'X';
      }
      if (board[i][j] == '#') {
        board[i][j] = 'O'; 
      }
    }
  }
};

const dfs = (board, i, j) => {
  const m = board.length;
  const n = board[0].length;
  if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n) return;
  if (board[i][j] != 'O') return;
  
  board[i][j] = '#';
  
  dfs(board, i + 1, j);
  dfs(board, i, j + 1);
  dfs(board, i - 1, j);
  dfs(board, i, j - 1);
};
```
