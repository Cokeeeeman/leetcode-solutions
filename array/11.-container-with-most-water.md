# 11. Container With Most Water

## Question

> Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate \(i, ai\). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at \(i, ai\) and \(i, 0\). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
>
> **Note:** You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

> The above vertical lines are represented by array \[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7\]. In this case, the max area of water \(blue section\) the container can contain is 49.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Brute force

The naive solution would be, find every pair of 2 bars and calculate the area, find the max one. Time complexity would be `O(n^2)`.

#### Solution \#2: Two pointers

Set 2 pointers at the very left and right point of the array. Calculate the area and keep updating the max value. Compare 2 bars, we change the shorter one because, the shorter bar is the bottleneck. The only way we might get bigger area is to move the shorter bar to next position.

Time complexity would be`O(n)`.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxArea = function(height) {
  let left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
  let max = 0;
  while (left < right) {
    const area = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
    max = Math.max(area, max);
    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left += 1;
    } else {
      right -= 1;
    }
  }
  
  return max;
};
```
