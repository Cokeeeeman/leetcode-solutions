# 904. Fruit Into Baskets

## Question

> In a row of trees, the `i`-th tree produces fruit with type `tree[i]`.
>
> You **start at any tree of your choice**, then repeatedly perform the following steps:
>
> 1. Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
> 2. Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.
>
> Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.
>
> You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each.
>
> What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,1]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [0,1,2,2]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: We can collect [1,2,2].
> If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [0, 1].
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,2,3,2,2]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2].
> If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [1, 2].
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].
> If we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `1 <= tree.length <= 40000`
> 2. `0 <= tree[i] < tree.length`

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Two Pointers

The question can be interpreted as, how to find the longest subarray that has at most 2 elements.

When you see subarray question, sliding window comes to my mind. We use 2 pointers `l` and `r` to represent the window. In the window, we make sure it's always 2 elements most. 

But how do we keep track of what elements are in the subarray? Use hash map.

We store element/type in the map as keys and its occurrences as values.

The idea is, loop thru the array. Each iteration, we check if it's at most 2 elements. If we run into a 3rd one. We need to shrink the window and get rid of one of the previous 2 types in our hash map. We'll move left pointer `l` and for each element it visits, we subtract the occurrence of that type, until one of the previous 2 types reaches 0. In this way, we can guarantee that, it's always at most 2 types for the subarray.

Time complexity would be `O(n)`. In the worst case, when every tree is different type. Pointer `r` will visit every element and `l` will pretty much visit every element too. So each element is visited twice.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} tree
 * @return {number}
 */
var totalFruit = function(tree) {
  const map = {};
  let l = 0, r = 0;
  let max = 0;
  while (r < tree.length) {
    const rType = tree[r];
    if (!map[rType]) {
      map[rType] = 0;
    }
    map[rType] += 1;
    if (Object.keys(map).length === 3) {
      while (l <= r) {
        const lType = tree[l];
        map[lType] -= 1;
        l += 1;
        if (map[lType] === 0) {
          delete map[lType];
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    
    max = Math.max(max, r - l + 1);
    r += 1;
  }
  
  return max;
};
```
