## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Naive

Based on observation, for any bar, if we use it as the height of the rectangle, it has to be the shortest one in the area. 

To calculate area of the rectangle, we need to know the width. We just need to find the first shorter bar on the left of current bar and the one on the right. 

`width = right - left - 1`

We calculate area for every bar and we track max value.

Time complexity would be `O(n^2)`.

#### Solution \#2: Stack

Same idea as previous solution. We calculate area for each bar with that bar as the shortest and we keep track of the max one. 

We maintain a stack. Iterate thru the array, keep pushing bars to the stack until a shorter one is seen, that is, current bar, `i`,  is shorter than the one on top of the stack, `x`.

Then we pop the bar `x`, calculate the area with this bar as height. To calculate the width, we need to find the first shorter bar on the both side of `x`. Current bar i is the one we need to find on the right side. The left one is previous item in the stack.

Time complexity would be`O(n)`. Because each bar is popped and pushed once.

## Code

#### Solution \#1

```text
/**
 * O(n^2)
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestRectangleArea = function(heights) {
  let max = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
    let l = i, r = i;
    while (l >= 0 && heights[l] >= heights[i]) {
      l -= 1;
    }
    while (r < heights.length && heights[r] >= heights[i]) {
      r += 1;
    }
    
    const area = heights[i] * (r - l - 1);
    max = Math.max(max, area);
  }
  return max;
};
```

#### Solution \#2

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestRectangleArea = function(heights) {
  const stack = [];
  let max = 0;
  let h, w, area;
  
  let i = 0;
  while (i < heights.length) {
    // as long as heights[stack.peek()] <= heights[i], keep pushing
    if (stack.length === 0 || heights[stack[stack.length - 1]] <= heights[i]) {
      stack.push(i);
      i += 1;
    } else {
      h = heights[stack.pop()];
      w = stack.length === 0 ? i : i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
      area = h * w;
      max = Math.max(max, area);
    }
  }
  
  while (stack.length > 0) {
    h = heights[stack.pop()];
    w = stack.length === 0 ? i : i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
    area = h * w;
    max = Math.max(max, area);
  }
  return max;
};
```
