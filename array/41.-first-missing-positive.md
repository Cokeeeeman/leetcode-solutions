## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Linear Space

The key idea is, the missing number must be \[1, n + 1\]. 

Why? Because it's trying to find the **smallest** **positive** missing number, which is \[1, n\]. Edge case would be the smallest n numbers are all taken, then n + 1 is our answer. This is why the final answer must be \[1, n + 1\].

We can also **proof it by contradiction**. Say the missing number X is larger than n + 1, then numbers from 1 to n + 1 must be in the array, which is n + 1 numbers and the array only has n places. So the number must be from \[1, n + 1\].

The rest is simple:

1. Create a hash to keep track of which numbers are in the array;
2. Iterate from 1 to n and see which is the first one that is not in the hash, return it;
3. If \[1, n\] are all in the hash, return n + 1.

Time complexity would be `O(n)`. Space would be `O(n)`.

#### Solution \#2: Constant Space

One thing for sure is we need to know whether numbers \[1, n\] are in the array. How do we achieve constant space without using an additional hash?

We can re-use the original input array. We'll use negative sign to represent the number is present. E.g. if `arr[5] = -1`, it means number `5` is in the array somewhere else. 

But what about the original non-positive numbers already in the array? We can transform them to something that won't affect our counting, e.g. '\#'.

Also we can use `arr[0]` to represent `n`.

So the algorithm is:

1. Traverse the array, for each `num` at index `i`:
   1. If `num` is non-positive, transform it to '\#';
   2. If `num` is positive and if index `num` is between `[1, n]`, change `arr[num]` to negative if it's a number or '&' if it's '\#'; 
2. Iterate from 1 to n and see which is the first one missing;
3. If all there, return n + 1.

Time complexity would be`O(n)`. Space `O(1)`.

## Code

#### Solution \#1:

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var firstMissingPositive = function(nums) {
  const set = new Set();
  for (let num of nums) {
    set.add(num);
  }
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++) {
    if (!set.has(i)) return i;
  }
  
  return nums.length + 1;
};
```

#### Solution \#2:

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var firstMissingPositive = function(nums) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] < 1) nums[i] = '#';
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] == '#' || nums[i] == '$') continue;
    const value = Math.abs(nums[i]);
    if (value >= 1 && value <= nums.length) {
        
      if (nums[value - 1] == '#') {
        nums[value - 1] = '$';
      } else if (nums[value - 1] > 0) {
        nums[value - 1] = - nums[value - 1];
      }
    }
  }
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i - 1] == '#' || nums[i - 1] > 0) return i;
  }
  
  return nums.length + 1;
};

```
