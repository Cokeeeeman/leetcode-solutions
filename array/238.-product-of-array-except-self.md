# 238. Product of Array Except Self

## Question

> Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers where _n_ &gt; 1,  return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

>
> ```text
> Input:  [1,2,3,4]
> Output: [24,12,8,6]

> **Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in O\(_n_\).

> Could you solve it with constant space complexity? \(The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.\)

## Analysis

For an index `i`, we need product of numbers before `i` and after. If for each `i`, we iterate thru all numbers before it and after, it's gonna cost `n` times for each iteration. So brute force solution will cost `O(n)` time.

However, the product of numbers can be accumulated, which means we don't have to calculate from scratch every time. E.g. if we have product from `0` to `i - 1`, say it's `product(0, i - 1)`, to calculate `product(0, i)`, all we need to do is`product(0, i) = product(0, i - 1) * nums[i]`.

So, for index `i`, all we need is, `product(0, i - 1)` and `product(i + 1, N - 1)`.

Use an array `productBefore` to store product before an index. So `productBefore[i]` represents the product of numbers before `i`.

We don't have to use an additional array to store `productAfter`. We can just use a variable to keep accumulating the product from `n - 1` to `i + 1` and calculate the final product of `i` on the run.

Time complexity would be`O(n)`. Space would be `O(1)` if output array does not count as extra space.

## Code

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var productExceptSelf = function(nums) {
  if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
  
  // productBefore[i] is the product of numbers before index i
  // e.g. if input is [1, 2, 3, 4], productBefore will be [1, 1, 2, 6]
  const productBefore = Array(nums.length).fill(1);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
    productBefore[i + 1] = productBefore[i] * nums[i];
  }
  
  // in the 2nd pass, we do it right to left
  // productAfter is the product of numbers after current one
  // here we don't have to use another array
  // just use one variable is sufficient because productAfter is accumulative
  let productAfter = 1;
  for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    productBefore[i] = productBefore[i] * productAfter;
    productAfter *= nums[i];
  }
  
  return productBefore;
};
```
