# 75. Sort Colors

## Question

> Given an array with _n_ objects colored red, white or blue, sort them [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) ****so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
>
> Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
>
> **Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
> Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
> ```

> * A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
> * Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: 2 pass

1. Count number of 0s, 1s and 2s;
2. Reassign

Time complexity would be `O(2n)`.

#### Solution \#2: 1 pass

Use 3 pointers, `l, r and cur`

`l` points to the rightmost boundary of 0s and `r` points to the leftmost boundary of 1s.

We'll use `cur` to scan the array and swap current number to either `l` or `r`.

Time complexity would be`O(n)`.

## Code

#### Solution \#2: 1 pass

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
 */
var sortColors = function(nums) {
  let l = 0, r = nums.length - 1;
  let cur = 0;
  
  // here we also consider when cur = r because
  // r points to the prev number of leftmost 2s
  // so the number r points to could be 'unscanned'
  while (cur <= r) {
    if (nums[cur] == 0) {
      swap(nums, cur, l);
      l += 1;
      
      // because if cur doesn't move,
      // it will mark the number as 'unscanned'
      // cur will always be equal or ahead of pointer l
      // because cur needs to get out of 0s zone
      cur += 1;
    } else if (nums[cur] == 2) {
      swap(nums, cur, r);
      r -= 1;
    } else {
      cur += 1;
    }
  }
};

const swap = (arr, i, j) => {
  let tmp = arr[i];
  arr[i] = arr[j];
  arr[j] = tmp;
};
```
