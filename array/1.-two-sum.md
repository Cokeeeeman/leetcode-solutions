# 1. Two Sum

## Question

> Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
>
> You may assume that each input would have _**exactly**_ one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.
>
>
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
>
> Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
> return [0, 1].
> ```

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1: Brute force

Time complexity would be `O(n^2)`.

#### Solution \#2: Two pass with hash table. 

Time complexity would be`O(2n)`.

#### Solution \#3: One pass with hash table. 

Iterate thru the array, for current element, store the `complement (target - current)` as key and current element as value. 

Time complexity would be`O(n)`.

## Code

#### Javascript

```text
/**
 * Solution #3
 * Time complexity: O(n), space complexity: O(n)
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    const table = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];
        if (table.has(nums[i])) {
            return [ table.get(nums[i]), i ]
        } else {
            table.set(complement, i);
        }
    }
    
    throw new Error('No such pair found!');
};
```
