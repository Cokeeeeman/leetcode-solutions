# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

## Question

> Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a\[i\] ≤ n \(n = size of array\), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

> Could you do it without extra space and in O\(n\) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

## Analysis

#### Solution \#1

Create an `array` as a lookup table for numbers. We initialize array with all 0, representing none of the numbers are seen. Then we iterate thru the array, when we see a number `nums[i]`, we update `array[nums[i]] = 1`, representing `nums[i]` is seen.

```text
E.g. nums = [3, 1, 1]
array will be like [0, 1, 0, 1]
So array[1] represents 1 is there, array[3] represents 3 is there.
```

Time complexity would be `O(n)`. But space would be `O(n)`.

#### Solution \#2

The idea is to use `nums[i]` to represent whether `i + 1` is present. If `nums[i]` is negative, `i + 1` is not present; else `i + 1` is present.

So we loop thru `nums`, let's say `nums[i] = 3`, that means `3` is here. So we need to mark `3` as visited. So we make `nums[3 - 1] = - nums[3 - 1]`.

Time complexity would be`O(n)`. But space would be `O(1)`.

## Code

#### Solution \#1, O\(n\) space

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findDisappearedNumbers = function(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  const arr = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    arr[nums[i]] = 1;
  }
  
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === 0) {
      result.push(i);
    }
  }
  
  return result;
};
```

#### Solution \#2, no extra space

```text
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findDisappearedNumbers = function(nums) {
  const n = nums.length;
  // first pass: mark numbers whether they exist using negative numbers
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // if nums[i] = 3, so we've seen 3, we'll make nums[3 - 1] as negative
    // which means, if nums[i] is negative, it means i + 1 has appearred
    // if nums[i] is positive, i + 1 not here
    const num = Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1;
    nums[num] = Math.abs(nums[num]) * -1;
  }
  
  const result = [];
  // second pass: find all positive numbers
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (nums[i] > 0) {
      result.push(i + 1);
    }
  }
  
  return result;
};
```
